## Introduction

Swarm robotics involves the study of large groups of relatively simple robotic agents that collectively accomplish tasks beyond the capabilities of individual robots. This framework provides a comprehensive toolkit for developing and simulating swarm robotics systems using the Julia programming language.

## Installation

To get started with the Swarm Robotics Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/swarm-robotics-framework.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd swarm-robotics-framework
   ```

3. **Install Julia**: 
   - If you haven't installed Julia yet, download it from [the official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions.

4. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Create and activate a new Julia environment:
     ```bash
     julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
     ```

5. **Run the Framework**:
   - Start the main program:
     ```bash
     julia swarm_robotics_framework.jl
     ```

## Usage

The Swarm Robotics Framework provides a flexible and extensible platform for developing and simulating swarm robotics systems. Here are some key features and usage guidelines:

- **Modular Design**: The framework is modular, allowing users to easily extend and customize its components for specific applications.
- **Communication Protocols**: Implement custom communication protocols for message passing and coordination among robots.
- **Algorithm Development**: Develop decentralized decision-making, swarm coordination, and navigation algorithms tailored to your swarm robotics tasks.
- **Simulation Environment**: Simulate swarm dynamics, emergent behaviors, and environmental interactions to analyze and optimize system performance.
